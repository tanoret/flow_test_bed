# ERCOFTAC Validation Cases

Cases taken from the ERCOFTAC database at: http://cfd.mace.manchester.ac.uk/ercoftac/doku.php

This is a folder to host the ERCOFTAC validation cases.
The cases should be documented as follows:

- Create a folder with your case number and short title, e.g., ERCOFTAC_CASE_013_Sudden_Pipe_Expansion
- Add a short readme file to the case folder explaining the test and the flow phenomena that the test is validating
- In the readme file, please keep the log of the date and runtime of the case, e.g., 'Run on 05/29/2024: 105 seconds'
- Include your postprocessing files for validation.
