This is the documentation for ERCOFTAC CASE 60: Swirling flow in a diffuser

It includes the script used, the input files for this script and the results. The results with curvature correction have been compared with the one obtained without these corrections. The value of velocity in the bulk of the flow is in both cases higher in the simulation than in the experiment, due to the way the turbulent viscosity is computed in the $k-\epsilon$ model ; indeed in both cases the model is too diffusive. The value of $\alpha$ for the curvature correction was arbitrarily set to 2, the function still have to be determined.
